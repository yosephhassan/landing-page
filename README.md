# landing-page
In this project I am going to use what I learnt in CSS and HTML to create a webpage similar to a full design in an image as part of my learning journey in The Odin Project.

# The Design
![outcome](./full-website-design.png)

# What I am going to do:
I am going to divide the design into sections and divs and then I am going to implement each div or section until it is fully done, first I will put the HTML that is needed for that section and then I will style it using CSS until it is similar to the above design. 
After that I am going to continue with the next section or div until I am done with the full webpage.
